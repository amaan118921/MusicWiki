### Some Important Points 

- The UI of the application can definitely get more improved, but I rather decided to spend more time on the Code Structure and Architecture so that it is Scalable and Maintanable.
- Didn't focused much on the UI, as at some places, the alignment of the views are not proper.
- Just have tried to replicate the UI provided in the assignment.
